				<div ><br><br>Owen Marshall at the launch of Magnus and Maungati's Christmas said: <br> "What are the qualities that make Jan's book successful?&nbsp; There's the word play, the sentiment ... the use of rhyme, but most of all there are humour and good will which are typical of Jan's own nature.&nbsp; The other essential and successful aspect of course is the illustrations provided by Richard Gunther.&nbsp; I'm no art critic but I find them delightful..." </div>
